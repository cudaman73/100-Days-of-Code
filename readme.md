https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code

This repository is created to contain all the projects that I'm working on while completing the course. I will attempt to keep them as organized as possible, and hopefully learn some python along the way.

Master Python by building 100 projects in 100 days. Learn to build websites, games, apps, plus scraping and data science.
